Pdrum
=====

These files contain models of parts for an electronic drum kit.
They are written in OpenSCAD.
Any STL files are merely exports of the default configuration of the models.

Users are encouraged to open the files in OpenSCAD and change parameters to suit their needs.
The models are parametric to a certain degree, and should be scaleable to larger sizes, but this has not been tested. 
The default configuration is printable as is on a MendelMax 3D printer (or other printer of equal or greater print area) and suited for 6" heads.

For now, only the drum base + rim and sensor platform is available.
Hi-hat pedal, kick pedal, clamps and DIY stand are in the works, but don't hold your breath :)
Cymbals will be omitted for now, since the angle makes them difficult to print without support.
